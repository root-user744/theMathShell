# theMathShell

Welcome to  the __theMathShell__. I used Kali Linux and was inspired by the bash shell, so I tried to make a similar shell but 
with the ParrotOS prompt (since it is more attractive) and with math commands. The "formulae.py" file inside the Formulae folder
contains all the function definitions of the formulae, you can add your own functions to that file and the "theMathShell.py" 
contains the main function.

### From the Author:
 This program runs just fine in LINUX. But I don't know what the bug is with Windows. When the first time you run the program
 it doesn't acts on the ascii codes of the program making it look ugly but still functional, and once you give the clear command 
 everything is fine and you can run the program just well. And before doing all of these you need to change the string "clear" 
 to "cls" in line 50 of "theMathShell.py" file inorder to make the clear command functional in Windows.
 
 This is the bug:

 After passing the command "clear":
